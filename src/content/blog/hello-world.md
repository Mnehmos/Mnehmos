# Hello World

Welcome to the Mnehmos blog. This is where I'll share thoughts on:

- **MCP Server Development** — Patterns, pitfalls, and production lessons
- **Multi-Agent Systems** — Coordination, handoffs, and the OODA loop
- **Building in Public** — Progress updates on Quest Keeper, Long Hall, and other projects

## Why a Blog?

Documentation lives in repos. Twitter is ephemeral. A blog is the middle ground—detailed enough to be useful, persistent enough to reference later.

## What's Coming

I'm currently working on:

1. **Quest Keeper AI v2** — Rebuilding the D&D companion with a unified Rust MCP server
2. **Sight MCP** — Giving Claude Desktop the ability to see your screen
3. **Prompt Taxonomy** — Interactive visualization of 200+ prompting techniques

Stay tuned.
